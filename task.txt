Create a searchable recipe book

Each recipe should have a name, a list of ingredients (single string is fine for now), and directions.

There should be a form for adding recipes and an index of recipes. Same page or different routes, don't care.
For the form, description should have a <textarea> as opposed to an <input>.

There should be basic validation, at least on the server side, if not on the client as well.
i.e. only recipes with String names, String ingredient lists, and optional String descriptions
should be allowed in the database. **No other fields should be allowed in the database.**

Recipes should be searchable based on name and ingredients, not directions.

It shouldn't look like total shit.

That is all.
